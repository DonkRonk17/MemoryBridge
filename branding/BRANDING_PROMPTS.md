# MemoryBridge Branding Prompts

**For DALL-E 3 Image Generation**

These prompts generate consistent branding for MemoryBridge following the Beacon HQ Visual System v1.

---

## PROMPT 1: Title Card (16:9 Landscape)

```
Create a title card image with a 16:9 aspect ratio in a professional tech style with a dark background (#0a0e27 navy).

The main visual should feature a glowing bridge or connection network spanning across a data landscape. Show multiple nodes or memory cells connected by luminous pathways, representing shared knowledge flowing between agents. Include visual elements like data streams, memory fragments (geometric shapes), and interconnected circuits.

Include the text "MemoryBridge" in a modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Inter) in bright cyan (#00d4ff), positioned in the lower third. Add the tagline "Cross-Agent Shared Memory" in smaller white text below it.

Use a color palette of navy blue (#0a0e27), bright cyan (#00d4ff), white (#ffffff), and accent colors for memory types (purple #a855f7 for agent, blue #60a5fa for team, green #4ade80 for global). Add subtle tech elements like memory cells, data nodes, connection lines, and a slight grid pattern overlay.

The overall mood should be connected, intelligent, and unified - conveying seamless knowledge sharing across agents.
```

## PROMPT 2: Logo Mark (1:1 Square)

```
Create a square logo icon for a cross-agent memory sharing system called MemoryBridge.

The design should feature a stylized bridge or connection symbol with memory nodes. Use a dark navy circle (#0a0e27) as the background. In the center, show a minimalist bridge shape made of glowing lines connecting 2-3 memory nodes (geometric shapes like hexagons or circles).

Use bright cyan (#00d4ff) for the bridge/connection lines, with small colored nodes representing different memory scopes (purple, blue, green dots). Add a subtle glow effect around the bridge structure and subtle data streams flowing across it.

The style should be modern, clean, and tech-forward - suitable for a professional developer tool. No text in this version - icon only.
```

## PROMPT 3: Horizontal Logo (3:1 Wide)

```
Create a wide horizontal logo banner (3:1 aspect ratio) for MemoryBridge.

On the left third, include a stylized icon of a glowing bridge connecting memory nodes - perhaps an arch or pathway with 2-3 connected nodes (geometric shapes) on either side.

In the center and right sections, display "MemoryBridge" in a bold, modern sans-serif font (like Outfit or Space Grotesk) in bright cyan (#00d4ff).

Use a dark navy background (#0a0e27) with subtle tech elements like data streams, memory cells, or connection lines flowing through the design. The bridge icon should have a slight glow effect in cyan.

Below or integrated with the text, add small colored indicators for the three memory scopes (purple, blue, green) to reinforce the "shared memory" concept.

Professional, clean, tech-forward style suitable for GitHub headers and documentation.
```

---

## PROMPT 4: App Icon (1:1 Square, Simplified)

```
Create a simple, bold app icon (1:1 square) for MemoryBridge that works at small sizes.

Design a minimalist icon featuring a bridge symbol connecting two memory nodes. Use a dark navy (#0a0e27) to bright cyan (#00d4ff) gradient as the background. The main symbol should be a simple, geometric bridge arc with a node (circle or hexagon) on each side.

Use white for the main bridge structure with small accent dots in scope colors (purple, blue, green) on or near the nodes.

Keep it very simple and bold - it should be recognizable even at 32x32 pixels. Modern, flat design style with subtle depth (maybe a slight shadow or gradient).

No text - icon only. Clean, professional, instantly recognizable as a memory/connection tool.
```

  - Team (shared): Blue (#60a5fa)
  - Global (universal): Green (#4ade80)

**Typography:**
- Headings: Outfit, Space Grotesk, or Inter (bold)
- Body: Inter or system sans-serif

**Visual Elements:**
- Bridge or connection pathway
- Memory nodes (geometric shapes)
- Data streams or flow lines

- Subtle tech elements (circuits, grids)
- Glow effects on connections

**Mood:**
- Connected and unified
- Intelligent knowledge sharing
- Professional and trustworthy
- Cross-agent collaboration

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
1. Forge requested this tool for cross-agent memory sharing
2. The design should emphasize connection, bridge, and shared knowledge
3. All images should work well on dark backgrounds (GitHub)
4. Maintain consistency with other Beacon HQ tools (tech-forward aesthetic)
5. Three memory scopes (agent, team, global) are key differentiator

**After generating images in ChatGPT:**
1. Download all 4 variations
2. Rename to: `memorybridge_titlecard.png`, `memorybridge_logo.png`, `memorybridge_logo_horizontal.png`, `memorybridge_icon.png`
3. Save to `MemoryBridge/branding/` folder
4. Present to Forge for approval
5. Update README.md with image URLs after GitHub upload
